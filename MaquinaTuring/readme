Maquina Turing 

programed in c++

using std::map will simulate an infinite tape that will be hable to
move to any direction and tape  will be manipulated by basic turin
machines:

right, left, Rn, Ln, shift right, write, print

everytime will show a menu with 3 options  queue, pop, and end
queue: will add characters on the right side and will show  where
the cabezal is.

pop: will move first character on the right on the tape init and
adding that character to first position on the leftside of the 
tape init, and will place a blank space into the first position
of the tape, and  will shift the blanck space to the right end
ofthe tape. Printing every place of the cabezal from first tape
place to the tape end.
